TODO
====
- Find the right size for images (Maybe use max size)
- Check if we can announce Luminis Amsterdam?? Can we already show a logo?

- Create a better looking first slide
- Make it possible to show the content items after a click
- Show in the slide there are more content items, go through them with cmd + arrows
- Maybe we can index the full stackoverflow content
- Improve look and feel tables by using a header row?
